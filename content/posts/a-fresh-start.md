I cleared away all old content, for a fresh new start.

I began blogging from around the time the original Blogger trend had begun. I blogged often from then until about 2011, where distributed systems work took over my interests.

I had a minor resurgence in 2015 due to having to change my hosting provider, bringing back some interest as I rediscovered to write, but ultimately it did not last long.

Here's yet another try, this time with a static website style of publish instead of **WordPress** which had dominated my years of hosting a blog.
